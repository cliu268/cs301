// Weigh with Weights
// https://xjoi.net/contest/5168/problem/2
/*
Description:
There are several pieces of weights of 1g, 2g, 3g, 5g, 10g, and 20g (the total weight is â‰¤1000g). You need to find out how many 
different total weights from the combinations of these weights.

Input:
A line of six integers a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 and a6 (indicating that 1g weight has a1, 2g weight has a2, ....20g weight has a6). 
These integers are the numbers of weights 1g, 2g, ...and 20g, respectively.

Output (do not forget "Total=" in your output):
Total=N (N indicates the number of different total weights that can be measured with these weights. This does not include the 
case where no weights are used at all.)

Sample input:
1 1 0 0 0 0

Sample output (do not forget "Total=" in your output):
Total=3

It means that 1g, 2g, 3g can be weighed out using the weights. Do not forget to print "Total=" in the output.
