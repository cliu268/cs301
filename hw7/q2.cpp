Description：
Given a tree with N nodes numbered from 1 to N, among which 1 is the number for the root. Please find out the depth of the tree.

Input：
The first line contains a number N. （1<=N<=1000）
In the next N lines, each line contains N single-digit numbers (each could be 1 or 0 only). When the value at j-th column and 
i-th row is 1, it means node i and j have an edge in between. Otherwise, there is no edge. 

Output：
